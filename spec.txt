A) A Function in which If I give a point and the matrix we get no: of live neighbours of that point

TestCases:
   Case 1) point on center (one neighbour)
   Case 2) point on center (more than one neighbour)
   Case 3) point on edge
   Case 4) point on side
   

B) A Function in which if we give a matrix it return the next generation matrix
   Loop that matrix
   Call function A for all the points--->we will get list of neighbours
   Check wheather that point is True(Live) or False(Dead)
   if that point is live(True)
      call function A
      	   it gives a dictionary in which says the no:of live cells and dead cells
	   According to that I apply the Rules
   But
   If that point is Dead(False)
       call function A
      	   it gives a dictionary in which says the no:of live cells and dead cells
	   According to that I apply the Rules

Rules:

If it is a LIVE Cell
   Rule 1 : 2 or 3 live neighbours [n == 2 or n == 3] ---> Cell will Live on next generation
   
   Rule 2 : Less than 1 live neighbour [n < 2]-----------> Cell will Die on next generation [Under Population]
   
   Rule 3 : More than 3 live neighbours [n > 3]----------> Cell will Die on next generation [Over Population]

If it is a DEAD Cell
   Rule 4: Exactly 3 live neighbours [n == 3] -----------> Cell will Live on next generation [Reproduction]


Test Cases:

a) Here Next generation matrix will be such that all cells are dead (3 * 3 matrix)
    Case 5)  Input matrix with no live cell
    Case 6)  Input matrix with one live cells
    Case 7)  Input matrix with two live cells but neighbours (Rule 2)
    Case 8)  Input matrix with two live cell but not neighbours
