A) A Function in which If I give a point and the matrix we get no: of live neighbours of that point
   TestCases:
   1. point on center
      a] Less than 2 live neighbour
      b] Greter than 3 live neighbour
      c] Exactly 3 neighbours
   2. point on edge
   3. point on side
   

B) A Function in which if we give a matrix it return the next generation matrix
   Loop that matrix
   Call function A for all the points--->we will get list of neighbours
   Check wheather that point is True(Live) or False(Dead)
   if that point is live(True)
      call function A
      	   it gives a dictionary in which says the no:of live cells and dead cells
	   According to that I apply the Rules
   But
   If that point is Dead(False)
       call function A
      	   it gives a dictionary in which says the no:of live cells and dead cells
	   According to that I apply the Rules
